        <h1>Other Resources</h1>
        <p>On this page you will find a variety of resources, tips, and some learned knowledge I have picked up.
          My hope is that through this platform I can lower the barrier of entry, even if just a little bit, for equestrians 
          everywhere who just want to better themselves and show their horses. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When I look back on the past decade of my life and my journey with horses, I reminicse on a time where I wasn't 
          always sure what I was doing. I failed. A lot. But through those experiences I learned valuable information that I want to 
          share with upcoming riders everywhere and to encourage them to keep going!

        <h1>Survival Guides</h1>
        <p>I remember my first NSBA world show as an overwhelmed 15 year old. At that point, I had already
          gone to other World shows as a groom and assisstant, but it was the first time I was an exhibitor and 
          horses I braided were entering the ring. It was an amazing experience, but I'm pretty sure I got far more 
          wrong than right at that show.

  <summary><h2>AQHA Congress</h2></summary>
  <p>You signed up for Congress, congrats! Get prepared for thousand of quarter horses, 10 year olds flying around on hoverboards wearing
    shirts more expensive than your current net worth, and getting 12 hours of sleep within a week.</p>

  <p>Don't let this scare you though! This is the place where legends are made. It's a show
    that everyone should go to at least one in their lives. If I was going for the first time I would want to be told:</p>
<div>
    <li>Make sure to set aside time for shopping. Even if you don't buy anything, you'll never see that many vendors again.</li>
    <li>Whatever you do, book a hotel far from the fairgrounds. Inside the gates you're safe, but outside is a different story.</li>
    <li>Take advantage of every legendary professional being around you. Watch them ride, go talk to them, etc.</li>
    <li>Go explore! All of the top names spend thousands of dollars making their "homes awy from home" and they are so cool!</li>
    <li>Finally, the Sweet Shop is life. Get a cinnamon roll and say hi to the owners!</li>

  <summary><h2>AQHA/AQHYA World Show</h2></summary>
  <p>OKC is probably one of my favorite show grounds, well, a close third to Tulsa. I can't think of a feeling that compares to walking through the Gateway of Champions the same way you've watched your idols 
    do many times before.
