      It's a classic tale as old as time. A girl falls in love with a horse. Sound familiar?
      Like so many others in this industry, I had one failed horse after the other. Until finally, two days before
      my 16th birthday, I met a scrawny, gangly, and super skittish gelding named Kippy. To say I fell in love instantly would be an understatement. 
      He was everything I had ever wanted in a horse: a deep red bay, heterochromia, a huge white face, chrome (white markings) for days, 
      and had the potential to "walk the lines" like no other in the hunter pen. So, after months of working with him and imagining a future
      where he is winning everything and everywhere, I finally got to ride him. Now, I'm a whole 5'1" and I looked way too big for him. 
      Admittedly in hindsight, he probably would have benefitted from waiting to ride him, but after so many horses
      I tried and they didn't work, we were more concerned about making sure he was a solid citizen.
