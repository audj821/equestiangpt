        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <p>In this section you will see the experiences of other users with my platform.
            I have invited several people from all across the horse show world to test out and critique Between the Ring's EquestrianGPT!</p>
        </p>
        <p>For my testimonials, I wanted to create a page that reflected the wide range of equestrians I want to reach. While I methodically
          chose those with varying ages and experience levels to test different levels of scrutiny and question elabority, I also wanted to showcase 
          the variablilty that EquestrianGPT can accomodate.
