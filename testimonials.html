        <h1>Testimonials</h1>
        <p>In this section you will see the experiences of other users with my platform.
            I have invited several people from all across the horse show world to test out and critique Between the Ring's EquestrianGPT!</p>
        </p>
        <p>For my testimonials, I wanted to create a page that reflected the wide range of equestrians I want to reach. While I methodically
          chose those with varying ages and experience levels to test different levels of scrutiny and question elabority, I also wanted to showcase 
          the variablilty that EquestrianGPT can accomodate.

    <p>Reese is a youth rider who focuses on over fence events. She has shown numerous times at every major 
      stock horse show in the country and has placed in the top 3, 5, and 10 numerous times. 
    </p>
    <p>"This was a super cool resource! Not only was I able to test it on certain questions I already knew the answer to, it
      also knew more than I did! I'm excited to use this for future shows and I think this will be very helpful to a lot of people."</p>

  <h2>User 2</h2>
  <p>Kimberly is an amateur rider from Wisconsin who, like Reese, focuses on the over fence events.</p>
  <p>"Having shown for as long as I have, there's a decent amount of the rules that get committed to memory. However, I was surprised
    to see that it was even able to correct my knowledge. Apparently over the years I've changed the rules slighly in my own head- which I didn't even realize. 
    Overall, I think this was a great idea and could help everyone in the show pen."</p>

    <p>Kiana is not only a rising profesional equine and event photographer, but is also an exhibitor herself. 
      She primarily rides in the all around but considers western pleasure to be her primary event.
    </p>
    <p>"This ChatGPT model works really well- it answered all of my questions thoroughly and provided
      lots of useful information. It's clear, detailed, and easy to understand, making it a great tool for learning 
      the rulebooks and solving problems. I'm impressed by how quickly and accurately it responds!"

    <p>Jordyn, while she hasn't been showing for nearly as long as the others,
      has plenty of experience behind her as well and has her own accomplishments at the AQHA Congress as well as the Level 1 Championships.
    </p>
    <p>"This ChatGPT was great! The questions I asked I never knew the answer to and I was able to learn. It's more accurate than Google is which is nice."</p>
