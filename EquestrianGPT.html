      <h1>The EquestrianGPT</h1>
    <p>Before jumping into what this resource is, I would love to share a brief personal anecdote. One time, 
      several years ago, I was at an AQHA show in Pennsylvania. My at the time trainer had brought me and several other
      students with her to get horses qualified for the world show that year. Well, it's important to note that at the time 
      I was showing a grey paint mare. Now, if you kow about gray horses in particular, you will be able to note that as they
      age, the horse does infact get lighter. At this point the horse I was showing was practically completetly white with just 
      a very light hint of grey. Which fine, in the events we showed in nobody batted an eye.
    </p>  
    <p>That was until I stepped into the halter pen to try my hand at the circuit show's highpoint award.
      I learned very quickly, though disqualification, that 1. "excessive white" is not appreciated by the judges.
     (Let's just say there's a reason most halter horses are brown) and 2. Eventhough her hooves were striped, some were solid black
     whereas others were black and white, they required her hooves to be clear coated. As it stood when I was showing, 
    the judges deemed it as artifically augmenting the horse's natural appearance.</p>
    <p>I add this story because I think it highlights perfectly the exact reason I started this project.
      I was thankful that it hapened at a state level show, bbut if it were Congress? That small mistake could have potentially
      costed my family hundreds of dollars in entry fees. This niche knowledge is far from common, but it should be 
      far more easily acessible than burried far in the association handbook.
