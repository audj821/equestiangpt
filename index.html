    <h1>Who we are</h1>
    <h3>"Creating a space where every rider belongs"</h3>
    <p>The Warmup Ring is an educational resource for equestrians all across the world. Our mission is to bring a collaborative
        aproach to breaking the barriers which keep equestrians from achieving their dreams. One of the biggest barriers for riders 
        of all ages and at all stages of life struggle with is the copious amounts of knowledge required in this sport. While to many 
        learning everything is a rite of passage, for many this is just unrealistic. 
    </p>
    <p>Everyone is busy and has something they put above all else. Children are still learning who they are, 
        some young adults are in college or are budding professionals, while adults are running their entire lives and those of their kids
        for the parents out there. The truth is, as the rest of the world has continued forging a path into the golden age of technology, 
        the equine industry is lagging behind. People ask questions on FaceBook groups and get criticized for not being an expert, 
        horse forums haven't been updated since the 2000's, and nobody has time to sit down and read a "how to ___" book (get creative with the title).
